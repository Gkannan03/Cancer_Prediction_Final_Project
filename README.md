# Cancer_Prediction_Final_Project

Problem statement:
                Given the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass, predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer using the Ensembling Techniques. Perform necessary exploratory data analysis before building the model and evaluate the model based on performance metrics other than model accuracy.
                
                
Solution:
        Step 1: Reading the dataset
        Step 2: Data cleaning
        Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
        Step 4: Data preprocessing 
              * Encoding
              * Split
              * Scaling
        Step 5: Model creation
              * Support Vector Machine
              * Voting Classifier
              * Random Forest
              * XGBoost
        Step 6: Model Evaluation
              Comparing each model and evaluating based on accuracy
